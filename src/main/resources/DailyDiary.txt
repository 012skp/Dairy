Today is 16 Jan 2022 time 12:50 AM.

I am not getting any sleep today. My heart is aching.
I had a call with my parents today and they are not happy with me reg my inter cast marriage.
That's because someone told them not to do marriage from Bihar. Better do the marriage in Bangalore only. And in Bihar only do the reception.
My father is fearing that he will be cut-off from society and family completely just because of this marriage which society doesn't approve.
My parents get easily distracted by anyone's saying. He should stay strong but he doesn't.
Today I heard I have no value in my society. Only those ppl have values who have any govt job. No one knows me.
I need to really do something about it.

Long Term GOALS ---
1. Earn a lot of money.
2. Grow your network everywhere.
3. Start a business in home town with that money.

How do you achieve the above three ? That you have to think and plan. You need to start working on that from tomorrow.
